As we're still not done with the Covid-19 situation, college life is still a couple of months away. I expect it to be quite a ride, with both ups and downs. A little bit of ugly always makes us grow. Still, I've only included the fun stuff in the poster :) 
P.S. I've made this poster using Canva. Github student developer pack did come in handy.
