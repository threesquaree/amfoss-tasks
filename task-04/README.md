I started this task watching a random tutorial on YouTube, which I now regret. The video was actually about making a cli app with another library called 'Typer'. It took me another day to understand argparse and finish the task.

I was getting the image initially in my local file but when I checked later, it showed the message "https connection lost" on the terminal. I think it was some issue with my editor or network. No issues otherwise.
