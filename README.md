### amFOSS task review üëÄ
I think the tasks were crafted perfectly for someone who's stepping into the world of programming and open-source. It focuses more on the core fundamentals which is exactly what a newbie needs to get started. Even the tiniest of things about the tasks made a huge difference in how I wrote code. I feel like I've progressed a lot in such a short time learning about different languages and frameworks. 

### Me, Myself and I üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I've been a tech enthusiast for as long as I can remember. I loved checking out interactive websites, flutter apps and watching videos on youtube about flagship tech I can't afford :P. I took comp sci in 12th grade and I'm familiar with python. Even though I don't have much exposure on Javascript and flutter I'm stoked to learn them and build a website of my own, namely using a three.js interface. I came to know about amFOSS from Quora and it did play an important part in me choosing Amrita. I've always wanted to contribute my own work to the real world and I believe amFOSS is the right place for that. For the past couple of months, I've also been trying new things to find what I'm really passionate about. One such thing that resonated with me was video editing. I started an editing page on Instagram over an year ago and it worked out pretty well for me. I had a few thousand followers, progressed a lot in Final Cut Pro and After Effects editing. Unfortunately, I had to deactivate it because of JEE prep:( .I've also been planning to do other stuff like designing in Figma and Adobe XD.
