    <p>I was pretty skeptic about the tasks in the beginning, especially the 10 main tasks. I’ve been following amFOSS even before I joined Amrita and I’ve seen the previous year tasks too. Compared to that, I found this year’s tasks a little more interesting. 
I tried doing the tasks sequentially but I kind of got stuck on task-3. I didn’t wanna be held back so I started doing some of the additional tasks and then moved on to the main tasks.</p>

<p>Speaking of the experience, I think the additional tasks were easier to handle. The main tasks require a lot of time, but as I progressed through each task, I got to learn a lot of different things. Thanks to task-2 and task-14, I started using terminal commands a lot. The flutter task (task-6) was pretty interesting to try out since I’m into app development. Task-3 was time consuming but not gonna lie, it’s thrilling when you see your code finally working.</p>

<p>I think the tasks are well structured and I know I’ve come a long way in such a short time.</p>
