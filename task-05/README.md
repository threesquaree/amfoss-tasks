# Let Me C
I started this task with fixing the major errors like the missing semicolons and spelling mistakes. Finally it came to a point where the code actually ran but it was in a infinity loop. I slowly came across other loop and increment errors. After almost 3 days, fixed most of the code but I was not able to figure out how to display the words I got right in the game. Other than that, the code works fine.
