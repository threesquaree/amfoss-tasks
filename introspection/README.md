# Introspection 
### Why must we choose you? 
I am a sucker for procrastination but it's not the same case with stuff I'm passionate about. For me, passion means something I can work on for long hours without realizing how much time I've spent on it. I've experienced flow in work only a handful of times but let me tell you, it's beautiful. I believe that coding and open source contribution can be something that I can do being both creative and productive, fuelling that workflow again. amFOSS would also be a great place for me to learn and grow with different people.

### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I'm planning to dive deep into Flutter and JavaScript while also doing some light video editing. I got pumped after checking out some amazing JS-based websites like [lusion.co](https://lusion.co/) and would love to recreate something like that. I also plan to combine my work in After Effects with the websites I build. 
Maintaining a good CGPA would also make a good plan ðŸ¥².

### How would you contribute back to the club? 
I'd love to work on redesigning the amFOSS website. If that day ever comes, that would be a pretty solid contribution for me :). I'd also like to help the club with video editing and design stuff.

### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
I have no suggestions on the selection process since it helped me grow a lot in just a month. According to what I've heard, the tasks keep refreshing every year, plus they follow this pattern of including tasks with core fundamentals which I absolutely love.
